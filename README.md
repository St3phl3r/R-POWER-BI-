# R-POWER-BI-

I was handed a data set regarding the performance of Hollywood movies as my first assignment. That data set was uploaded to PositCloud, where I cleaned and analysed it. Please see below the cleaned-up R script. I discovered throughout my study that the original code for the missing data was flawed. I continued my research and discovered a working code. is.na(df) = = 0, J; df - df rowSums;


I have uploaded my clean data set into PowerBi after extracting it from R in order to produce an easy-to-read graphic for the customer to see. The customer asked to see: 
The profitability per studio, the quantity of films produced per year, the average ratings for each genre, and the number of films that audiences have rated favourably. • The global revenue for each category 
I have further added: 
• The total number of years in each genre; • The sum of each genre's worst films; The customer demands that their brand's colours—blue, brown, and green—be used.
